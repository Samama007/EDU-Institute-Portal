The following project is an online portal for an educational institute coded in dart with HTML and CSS used for Frontend. It has different sections for different roles, like teachers and students. Each role or section has its own unique attributes and storage system independent of the other. You operate the portal as administrator or moderator and can perform various functions.

The teacher's section has qualities like teacher' name, their subject and salary which are saved into the portal. It also provides the administrator the functionality of hiring new teachers or removing those currently employed. It also allows you to check the status of active teachers and their particularities.

Likewise, student portal has the functionality of enrolling a new student and removing them also. The student qualities which differentiate them is their name, grade or class and their Guardian's name. Further fields can be added depending upon requirements of the end user.
These attributes allow you to also check the student and ex-student of your institute.

The project has a minimalistic and simplistic UI, yet its modern looking with appealing colors, fonts and ai generated images. It allows smooth navigation between different pages or portals and saves the inputted data until the site is refreshed or stream is interrupted.

The project is definitely not in the finalized state, but it provides a strong starting point for further development and enhancement according to the requirements of the end user. Just attaching any sequel database will push the data which can be then saved permanently. It also has the potential for adding further roles and attributes wherever necessary.
